Project Title
GoRyde - Ride Booking and Management Platform

Project Idea
GoRyde is a platform that helps users book and manage rides easily. It offers unique features that set it apart from other apps:

Auto Pickup Mode: Users can activate auto pickup mode to schedule a taxi at the precise time they need, ensuring they arrive at the office on time.
Travel Anywhere Membership: Subscribers can enjoy up to 7 rides per day throughout the city at any time.
Complaint Management: Users can raise complaints if they face issues with the app or drivers, and agencies will resolve them within a few hours.
Pet-Friendly Rides: GoRyde welcomes pets in taxis and bikes, promoting a pet-friendly environment.
Project Description
The GoRyde platform will be built with two main parts:

Frontend: Developed using Vite (React) for fast performance and a smooth experience.
Backend: A separate service to handle data, manage users, and send emails.
