## ðŸš€ Project Title
**GoRyde - Ride Booking and Management Platform**

## ðŸ’¡ Project Idea
GoRyde is a platform that helps users book and manage rides easily. It offers unique features that set it apart from other ride-booking apps:

- **Auto Pickup Mode**: Users can activate auto pickup mode to schedule a taxi at the precise time they need, ensuring they arrive at the office on time.
- **Travel Anywhere Membership**: Subscribers can enjoy up to 7 rides per day throughout the city at any time.
- **Complaint Management**: Users can raise complaints if they face issues with the app or drivers, and agencies will resolve them within a few hours.
- **Pet-Friendly Rides**: GoRyde welcomes pets in taxis and bikes, promoting a pet-friendly environment.

## ðŸ›  Project Description
The GoRyde platform consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend**: Developed using **Vite (React)** for fast performance and a smooth experience.
- **Backend**: A separate service built with **Express.js**, managing data, user information, and email functionalities.
